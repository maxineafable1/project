      During the first semester of my first year as a nursing student was tough,but that journey taught me a lot. From learning the different kinds of caring and history of nursing, and being able to understand myself more, conquering my fear from doing specific tasks. This semester taught me to be more flexible in things that need to be done. It enables me to be more wary of myself, I also learned how our body works and what are the importance of each of our body parts. This program takes a lot of courage to pursue this journey so take every steps seriously

      During the first semester, I learned about the foundation of nursing, including its history and how it originated. I gained a better understanding of the basic principles and theories that guide nursing practice, even though we haven't fully demonstrated these skills yet. We also discussed how to apply these concepts in real-life situations to provide better care for patients. Another important lesson was learning the importance of professionalism, which includes acting with respect, responsibility, and compassion at all times. These lessons helped me build a strong base for my journey as a future nurse

      One of the most important lessons I have learned is the importance of patient-centered care. Nurses are the bridge between patients and the rest of the healthcare team. Through my coursework, I have developed skills to communicate effectively, build trust, and advocate for the needs of patients. I learned how empathy and active listening can make patients feel valued and understood, which is an essential part of healing.

      Academically, I definitely adjusted to a much more accelerated place and higher independent learning standard than in high school. Time management became my new best friend (or worst enemy, depending on the week!). My new found lesson was of proactive studying instead of being a crammer for most exams. But otherwise, I learned much greater lessons outside the books. I discovered new strengths that I did not know I possessed, as well as some weaknesses that I had to work on. I learned to reach out for help when I needed it, most often to professors, classmates, and my family. Most importantly, I learned how important self-care is among all the stress that came with a new environment.
