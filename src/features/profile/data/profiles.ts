      In GE Elective 1, I've learned a lot about the world of coding and programming. At first, it seemed complicated, but as I kept practicing, I started to understand how everything works. The course teaches you to stay focused because one small mistake can cause the whole code to fail. I've had the chance to work on creating a chatbot and even build a simple robot. The experience has been both challenging and exciting, especially when I see my work come to life. Although coding can sometimes feel stressful, I enjoy the sense of accomplishment when things finally click. It's a subject that pushes me to think critically and solve problems in new ways. I'm looking forward to learning even more as I continue in this course.

      If my plans to become a nurse don't work out, I won't just give up. I've always dreamed of being a flight attendant, and I think it's time to focus on making that dream a reality. I've always loved the idea of traveling, and I know it's something I would enjoy doing. I'll start looking into the training I need and begin applying to airlines. It might feel like a big change, but I'm excited to see where this path could lead. No matter what happens, I know I'll keep pushing forward and working hard. With the right mindset and effort, I believe I can make this dream come true.

      Fundamental Coding, also known as GE Elective, is a really fascinating subject, but it's also challenging because of the different codes that are used.

    In our GE Elective 1 coding course, I explored HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. Mastering problem-solving and data structures while honing debugging skills.

      If my plans on pre-med didn't work, I would definitely pursue my "The One That Got Away" course which is AGRICULTURE. A key to why agriculture is important to business and society is its output from producing raw materials to contributing to the global supply chain and economic development. Agriculturists are important because they specialize in the cultivation of crops and raising livestock, and provide advice on: soil management, crop rotation, irrigation and drainage, environmental stability, disease, and harvesting.

Think positive and do our best to make the plans work.
